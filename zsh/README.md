# rajayonin's Zsh setup

My preferred shell is [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/).

Special thanks to [dreamsofautonomy](https://github.com/dreamsofautonomy).

## Prompt
The prompt theme is [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/). Please make sure to install it beforehand.

## Plugins
The plugin manager is [Zinit](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit), with the following plugins:
<!-- - [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k): Theme (prompt, etc.). -->
- [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)
- [zsh-completions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions)
- [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
- [fzf-tab](https://github.com/Aloxaf/fzf-tab)


### Oh-my-zsh plugins
Although I don't use omz (too slow), Zinit allows us to take advantage of [its plugins](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins):
- [git](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/git)
- [command-not-found](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/command-not-found)


## Integrations
There are a couple of integrations with some packages, so please install them:
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
- [zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide)
